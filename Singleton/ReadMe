In Singleton pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client
and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Usages : Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications.
        It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.

Step 1
Create a class(ManBrain).

Step 2
Create a static object of the class.

Step 3
Mark the constructor as private, causes the class not be instantiated from outside

Step 4
Create a method that returns the object
