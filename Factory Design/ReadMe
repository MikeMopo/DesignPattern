In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client
and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Usages : A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of applications,
        but allow for individual applications to define their own domain objects
        and provide for their instantiation.

Step 1
Create an interface (Student).

Step 2
Create concrete classes (Male and Female) implementing the same interface.

Step 3
Create a class (Factory/StudentService) to generate object of concrete class based on given information.

Step 4
Use another class (StudentImpl) to implement the object of concrete class by passing an information such as type.
